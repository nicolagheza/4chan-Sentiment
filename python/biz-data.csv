95,1512925562,4938000," yea that too.   Best not to look at the charts and guess the buy/sell targets. Buy is usually the point where the volume increased and the top is market driven. Depends on how many they can get to fomo in. They might dump before a pump too now so they can shake weak hands and then pump it getting them to fomo back in. Or they give up for a bit seeming as they pumped it already. It's too easy to pump through with the collosus news. Easier than XLM was with IBM and the rocket ship logo lol.

I've been watching platinum for almost 2 years now, I've been making a few threads talking about platinum the past month or so generally once a week I'll make a thread, more so to get other like minded people into a space where we can all get GAINS!  Do you have a discord? https://discord.gg/wdxGh8a There's 21 of us, probably about 3/4 of us that do non-crypto trades, we've recent become more active as more people are investing in platinum, it's GAINSVILLE right now.  Come join for GAINS, this is ***NOT*** A PUMP AND DUMP GROUP, but it is a group to post GAINS, talk among other like minded people.  What's plus500 you shill? It's using leverage to bet if a stock is going to go up or down, it's a HIGH RISK, but ULTRA HIGH GAINS, if you missed the bitcoin MOON then EVERYTHING CAN MOON, because of leverage, you can also leverage crypto, it's used for using small amount of money for HIGH GAINS.  NOTE: Plus500 has NO REFEREAL PROGRAM, I PURELY just want more people to talk about platinum/crypto with because things are boring as shit solo, and no I do not expect money if my predictions make you a lot of cash, which they appear to be spot on, I just want to see more people with more money, that they've earned through my advice, due to my stock addiction this makes me happy.  Now the intro is out of the way:  Last week was crazy, we saw platinum fall from $958, down to now $890!, IT'S UNDER $900.  Silver is low as hell too.  I did some investigations and pic related is the last 3 years month by month what happens to metals, which means in the next week ALL metals are going to start up-trending, platinum has some mines that shut down but the demand is high so this will push platinum up, as you would expect.  End of last week we saw platinum hit 882 which is crazy, the last few times platinum has hit this low is right before it MOONED.

ETH will be doing tens of millions of transactions soon. This 1 million right now mostly is just Etherdelta (a DEX) and Cryptocats. Loads of decentralized exchanges (DEX's) will launch in Q1/2 of 2018, like Ethfinex for example (by Bitfinex, running on ETH and 0x).  As for the rest.. SHITLOADS OF COINS AREN'T EVEN USED.
