360,4917827,1512847242,I have found myself taking on a job for a friend that I would not have otherwise taken if I had known it was only going to pay minimum wage. There are other people I work with who I also believe deserve far more money than they are currently earning.   The manager comes into work for a couple of hours once or twice a week and demands the owner pays her £200 for it despite us being able to run the place smoothly without her. She doesn't do much at all and is never in to offer support even if we did need her.  How do I successfully renegotiate wages? Should I wait until after xmas to bring it up to the owner?,
