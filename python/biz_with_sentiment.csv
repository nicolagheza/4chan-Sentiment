Be the alfa and tell the NEETS that you fuck a hot girl who happens to have a kid but you?re fine with it since she?ll have many brothers once you impregnate the euroslut. Still a cuck tho
316,4919081,1512850987,Heres where you are on her totem pole cuck >herself >her child >your wallet >her lovers >her friends >you >your kid
317,4919097,1512851014, Feels good bud. are you mad that I am not unhappy with my life? this shit is confusing. should I aspire to attain your lifestyle in order to achieve happiness?
318,4919127,1512851114, My water heater broke... I dont want to fix it. and I dont want to go out and buy one. im procrastinating like a mother fucker. and enjoying myself haha. I like people grasping at air over the internet trying to figure out my situation.
319,4919128,1512851115, Does your wife prefer white or black cocks?
320,4919173,1512851264, Black obviously If she prefered white she wouldnt be swinging
321,4919184,1512851327," you dont know much about women who have come out of abusive relationships. she is not at the top of her own totem. Oh just a side anecdote as a ""husband and wife"" bonding experience . we have been getting certified to Dive. we just finished advanced open water in malaysia last year.   her kid loves me :) its nice  Im hopeing when she starts working as a ultrasound tech I can quit my job and do the stay at home dad thing for a wile.   she has no lovers.  she has no friends other than me in the US"
322,4919194,1512851346, If he lets blacks fuck his wife there is no salvation for him.
323,4919226,1512851424, >midwest Sounds like hell on earth
324,4919255,1512851520," if this isnt a LARP, holy shit I feel bad for you"
325,4919271,1512851557, white. she hasnt been with a black dude yet. shes talked about it though. she didnt like the last DP because the dude was to hung her favorite dick range is between 6'' to 7'' anything over 8 is to much for her shes more about girth no skinny dicks allowed. (my dick is 6'' by 6'' girth) she doesnt really care about age. weve had 20 yo's involved and 55 yos. (only had 5 mmf 3 somes during our marrige and 3 ffm) we want to go on a swingers cruise this year and go crazy
326,4919297,1512851619, ^^ are you me?
327,4919356,1512851798," whats your situation?   bro, we are both minorities. why in the fuck would I care if she slept with a black dude? I grew up with blacks. and latinos. only 2 white kids where in my grade when i was in elementary school (around 70 or 90 kids in my grade i think, high school was more diverse. ) anyways. she had only seen 5-10 black dudes before she came to the US. there are close to none where shes from. props to anyone who can figure out what country shes from based off the information gathered so far"
328,4919391,1512851927, What do you guys anticipate the world will be like in 20 years? (im assuming your in your early 20's or in your teens)   Im glad i found a fulfiling relationship as early as I did. I would hate to have to play the dating game all the way into my 40's and then know my wife only married me for money.
329,4919501,1512852216, Whatever bro it?s your life. I?m more traditional and wouldn?t share my wife lol. I think you were too young for marriage and should have partied out your early 20s but w/e rocks your boat.
330,4919531,1512852324, Is she jungle asian?
331,4919558,1512852404,"  She will be hooked on black dudes once she has her first.   It isn't a meme, the combination of the taboo, skin contrast and thick black cock will do things to her brain that is irreversible. Definitely get her blacked anon."
332,4919590,1512852480, You are so fucking stupid and autistic on so many different levels it makes me sick
333,4919642,1512852692," personally i hope the normies lose their fucking shirts, You dont see the tdameritrade or etrade apps being downloaded like coinbase. They are doing it because they want to make a couple bucks, they wont hold for the mood swings."
334,4919675,1512852807," skin contrast.... that might be a problem theres more skin contrast between her and a white guy also, what happens if there is no tabboo? a tabboo doesnt exist in her country. there simply just isnt alot of blacks.she will get blacked eventually though. I want to fuck a black chick to. havent had the chance yet. idealy we can find a black couple to swing with.    jungle yes asian no.    I partied before Getting married with her and while married to her. we didnt start living together properly till I was 24. But bassically I dropped out of high school at 17 to go backpacking with money I saved up from selling drugs. Traveled spain, South east asia. and south america. I got bored of the life after that. right around when i met her. we decided we wanted to get married after 3 months of being together (we bassically met at a hippy hovel where I was living and she was working. she didnt want to be with me. I got her drunk and fucked her one night. that got the ball rolling.   after that I lived the single life in the Midwest wile working and saving up to buy a house."
335,4919676,1512852815, Tbh your life (assuming it?s not larp) sounds comfy af.
336,4919678,1512852822, i hope you have a prenup
337,4919746,1512853023," Fuck u, I can't figure out if you're a troll or not. You've triggered everyone, I'm going to pasta some of your posts on pol later for salt mining purposes.  Cryptos aren't the stock market, and wife's aren't for sharing. Fuck."
338,4919784,1512853131," not larping buddy. and it is pretty comfy. I lived ""fast"" for quite a long time. helped me evaluate what exactly it was i wanted in my life. and how much money I require to attain the lifestyle I want. as long as I continue to follow the plan set in place il be good. I have no need for 20 million dollars.... I lived a happier life when I was slumming it in the third world with my wife then i have here wagecucking making 60k a year. however these are a means to an end. I also realize i cant have a fulfilling life with 0 dollars in my wallet. nor maintain a relationship with a child involved. If anything crypto was something that I ran into unexpected and ive had fun doing it. I no longer compete in sports and the rush of crypto gains gives me a similar type of feeling.    I have a TDameritrade account."
339,4919869,1512853421," Im not religious. we only got married for political purposes. how was she going to come live with me in the US if we werent married.... if she wherent my wife would she be fair game for sharing? I always wanted a relationship where I could be sexually envolved with other people. so I went out and found one. my wife is my best friend. its awesome....   eh im invested in FUN. gambling wont fail. humans gamble my crypto will be alright, if I can turn my investment into 50k in the next 2-3 years il be happy. that will allow me to do something tangeble with my money like pay off my house.   how long do you think it will be till crypto is widely accepted? do you think the third world will exept crypto ?"
340,4920299,1512854701," im heading into a similar direction with a brown skin girl. beside the swinger thing and to a certain degree the thing with the child i can pretty much understand your decissions.  you just make the shit that makes you happy. others consider it cuck or stupid. but those same guys fucking care too much about what others think and the shit that is ""considered"" to be a good life. in the end of the day its about hapiness."
341,4920464,1512855156, >coinbase app number 1 on AppStore
342,4920557,1512855419, YOU THE MAN ANON kick ass and make it work. we didnt start off as swingers. its relatively new to our relationship. but we are happy with it. it might just be a phase haha ..... brown skin girls are loyal as shit. and i love the fact that she isnt on snap chat or instagram. and doesnt care about what cell phone she has.   Asian? or Latin?   The good ol RPG of life
343,4920574,1512855486," I can't relate re women, there's absolutely no way I'll tolerate any form of nagging or female bullshit from a woman who isn't exclusive with me. I'm not going on about this because my opinion is obviously vastly different from yours.  Back on subject re cryptos; yes, they'll replace the USD standard that you obviously encountered in Cambodia and Ecuador.  These nations have experienced enough Mugabe school of monetary policy to have a natural preference for stable/growth assets. Basically a new era has arrived and cryptos are currently proving that decentralized networks can handle exponential increase in load and will scale up to supply the demand.  This will lead to decentralized web hosting and it'll also nuke mysql/oracle soon as blockchain improves data aggregation and speed of requests.  Btc gainz are just drawing in the normies like you by appealing to your lust for profits, and you're being forced to reconsider the relationship between the state and money supply blowing out any possibility of socialism ever being a thing again.  We're heading into a world of merit oriented reward and an end to monopolies. This can't be stopped now, watch Zimbabwe and south Africa re cryptos replacing national currencies.  Argentina too, the world as we know it today is running on recurring bailouts from gfc called qe (quantitative easing) and this money will certainly find it's way into btc eventually. Soon home owners like yourself will start to move your mortgage equity and credit cards into btc and then you'll walk away from the usd debt. Housing market is doomed, soon houses will be places to live, not speculation assets. Enjoy the ride."
344,4920690,1512855907,"  Notice the key word ""fake""?  Aka, not fucking real?  Why not fuck a fake pussy while you're at it?  Plastic tits are enjoyed by faggots that can't admit they're gay."
345,4920708,1512855975, Hopefully all of them.
346,4920887,1512856569, its just permanent makeup. besides fake tit tech is top tier now
347,4920972,1512856817, Lmao
348,4920982,1512856833, have you ever felt a fake tit buddy? ive fucked a fleshlight its not the same as real pussy. however fake tits are pretty spot on from the real thing. no scar when done via the arm pit. im happy with it. and more importantly my wife will be... its important to keep your womens self esteem up annon.    havent been to cambodia or ecuador :)  I back to the crypto. after having live in the third world for quite a few years I dont believe they will adopt crypto for another 10 - 20 years if not more. you have to wait till the people in power die off and more importantly the mindset of the people change. how many generations that may take is anyone's guess. il keep investing 4% per paycheck into cryptos since i believe its worth the gamble. other than the dept I owe on the mortgage I have no dept. I believe purchasing a house was the smart move in my situation. the idea of paying rent blows my mind.   and why do you assume i was drawn in by my lust for profit? if that was the case I would have gone balls deep and chucked more than 4% per pay check at it. haha.  Do you believe BTC will still be the king in the future?
349,4921170,1512857366, Im so glad shes the one who brought it up. by no means is she lacking in the looks department imo but a boob job will compliment her so well  her measurements are 33-25-37
350,4921227,1512857561," I can't explain my opinions or positions to you and have you understand what and where I'm coming from. We're too far apart thought wise, I'll leave you with one question and a follow up statement that I hope you think about.  How many USD Fiat dollars exist?  It's an unknowable quanitity and you should figure out why it's unknowable then you'll understand where the crypto prices will go. Take care and research any alt coins before buying, bancor is a good case study for you to look into in this regard.  Take care! :)"
351,4921230,1512857567, >thinks the dip is over  We are going to 11k maybe as low as $9k
352,4921291,1512857797, damn brah! your about to leave me just like that!  let me tell you I understand this much. The dept on my fucking house was created the day I purchased it... some ass hole just typed it into his computer and now im paying for it with FIAT

400,4917974,1512847696," Not sure, but to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to be a Chainlink investor. The hints are extrenely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the banking system most of the hints will go over a typical newfags head. There?s also Sergie?s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from satoshi nakamoto's literature, for instance. The investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise it?s not just brilliant- it can change people's LIVES. As a consequence, people who dislike Chainlink truly ARE idiots. Of course they wouldn?t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergie?s existential catchphrase, ?Oracles R Us,? which in and of itself is a cryptic reference. I?m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Chainlink development team's genius wit unfolds itself on their Binance trading screens. What fools... how I pity them."

445,4918841,1512850339,Byteball is better tech.
446,4918862,1512850392,  Because they just hired a producthunt dev that will professionally shill the fuck our of XRB with the mobile app while byteball will remain unknown forever
447,4918905,1512850487, Where do you even buy this shit? It's not even listed on Blockfolio
448,4918906,1512850487," it's fundementally different retard but yes, because at minimum it's decentralized.   >waiting Yeah I remember saying this in 2013"
449,4918917,1512850526, 3.2k here. Just waiting to be able to move them to mobile wallet or a better exchange. High hopes for this one.
450,4918921,1512850549, I meant on technical merits ya dingus
451,4918986,1512850750," >waiting  Waiting on bitcoin in 2013 is not the same as waiting on shitcoins in 2018. I am not a daytrader. I am looking to get in for a long term hold, so I need to optimize my entry point. You would be deluded to think that there won't be a massive bloodbath of all the Top 100 alts when bitcoin crashes. That's the time to buy (unless you're planning on daytrading before then)"
452,4918996,1512850776,Why do they put a minimum withdrawal amount of 100? I just wanna test this shit
453,4919000,1512850785,  I mean... if you just called me mr. smarty pants code monkey... why on earth would I bother trying to explain it to you? The information would pass right through you.   You should just go buy BTC or ETH and call it a day.
454,4919168,1512851256," If BTC really ""crashes"" it's spot is being immediately replaced by BCH or ETH and probably lots of alt moon trips. Everyone knows any BTC below 8k is instant free money, it will not crash that hard imo (and if it does it's simply replaced and dead forever), it's too late for it too die. It's become too robust. I think you might be waiting for awhile m8, and when the time comes it may be the wrong train to hop on.  Now is a great time to get into alts, BTC dominance is at it's highest and the mania is spreading like wildfire. Be ahead of the pack, not behind."
455,4919274,1512851566," There was no need to say you have a masters as if that's some sort endorement with merit. Vitalik created ETH and had no degree. On a similar note, many of the technical details only take an understanding of the terminology and concepts to comprehend, it's not like we're auditing the code, testing for vulnerabilites or doing any sort of math at all to determine the projects worth. I just thought that  >hurr durr I have a masters listen to me  Was kind of a shitty sentiment, when you could've instead used the knowledge your education bestowed upon you to actually explain the merits.  So for those reasons it struck me as something you can't really explain the merits of offhand and now you're playing the ""well I'm not gonna tell u if ur a meanie!"" card. But, I'm interested, so feel free to prove me wrong.  I already have XRB bags because I know damn well ByteBall isn't going to be the next DAG hype train, but this might."
456,4919300,1512851629," >000 And btw, nice."
457,4919311,1512851664,Ill leave this here. https://dev.smartcontract.com/#overview
458,4919361,1512851821,Went all in. This shit is an easy 10x once it hits a real exchange. The coin also has hardly any whales because of the faucet distribution.
459,4919430,1512852024," Good post  XRB seems promising, but I'm STILL uncertain about what their consensus algo is. There's private blockchains for every node (not sure why), and _some_ sort of consensus between the graph of nodes. Somebody should spoon feed this to us who didn't bother reading the whitepaper."
460,4919449,1512852075, It?s proof of stake basically.
461,4919456,1512852094," It's not a guaranteed 10x. It's still even more beta than IOTA (considering the wallet is fugly and takes days to sync on a HDD), and it might fade into obscurity. What matters, is the tech better than IOTA's in practice?"
462,4919515,1512852269, The wallet is ugly but it fucking works unlike IOTA. The light desktop and mobile wallets are coming out this month plus listing on a new exchange.
463,4919516,1512852273," Okay thanks. So, PoS with DAG? Sounds solid. Certainly more solid than IOTA's turning out to be"
464,4919547,1512852362," Great, gonna have to research and accumulate some more then. Already turned 700 bucks into something like 2k"
465,4919593,1512852493,"  The while a BS in CS teaches you code and technique, MS CS curriculum dives into systems and theory which is more applicable here.   It's hard for me to simplify concepts and explain to others, which is why I will never pursue a career as an educator."
466,4919604,1512852533," As far as I know the wallet is orders of magnitudes better than IOTA's and it has no aspect of centralization like IOTA. XRB is more orientated towards person to person transactions (like buying coffee) whereas IOTA is Internet of Things, machine to machine transactions (transactions here representing the communication of data through the multitudes of machines on an IoT network via there feeless model). The part I'm curious about is their ""lattice"" model. I'm not sure how DAG/Tangle or Blockchain like it is, it strikes me as a hybrid of some sorts from what little information I've skimmed over so far.   But I don't know, I know more about ByteBall. I could research it but would rather shitpost, I'm sure the returns will be OK since it's been gradually building hype without being on any real exchanges. I'll dig a litte deeper after my coffee, I'm extremely interested in DAG tech (anything with fast confirmation times), but ByteBall, my true love, is going nowhere fast."
467,4919628,1512852630," I understand what an MS delves into, I've considered that career option myself pretty heavily.   As the saying goes, if you can't explain it you probably don't understand well enough. So I guess I was right, and you don't really have any opinion other than a high one of yourself and your investments."
468,4919783,1512853129,  Well done.  At least you have RaiBlocks.
469,4919951,1512853701," So are you admitting you don't have anything of worth to say about this project? And don't give me that ""I can't simplify it"" crap, just don't simplifiy it so much if you have trouble. I'm genuinely interested in hearing your opinions on this project in how it compares to one in an identical use case, ByteBall."
470,4920267,1512854600," So you're just going to let this thread slide into the archives without defending yourself huh, brainlet?"
471,4920962,1512856799,you cant even buy this shit anywhere?
472,4921007,1512856896,"BTW, how does RXB prevent spam? It seems like it has no spam protection in place."
473,4921165,1512857354," First tx per hour is free, then apparently you pay something like 0.001 XRB per txs to prevent the spam"
474,4921185,1512857419," Ah okay, thanks"
475,4921194,1512857444," sounds like, hypothetically, 24 people/machiens could span the network by taking advantage of that easily"
476,4921222,1512857540,I'm all in with 500k coins  As soon as it gets on a real exchange it will 10x
477,4921226,1512857559, I think the costs will be too high and the advantages too low to perform such a spam attack. The 0.001 is MXRB btw
478,4921263,1512857697, and 24 machines performing 1 free txs per hour isnt really spamming..
479,4921270,1512857712,  >iota is centralized meme  ok. People aren't buying iota for the current state of the network you fucking numbskull
480,4921730,1512859144,"See pic related. Cryptobridge is a low volume decentralized exchange, but I really doubt it will be the only exchange to add it this month and every little bit helps when XRB is already pumping as is. We're at an all time high in USD at the moment, and number 3 in 24-hour change after Nexus and Litecoin. Get in or stay poor."
481,4921775,1512859292,"Plebbit is shilling the fuck out of this coin more and more, last coin that was shilled this much was IOTA. It's #13 in 24-hour social volume according to solume.io, and exchange volume is on the uptick again. This is such a comfy hold."

As miners are the ones doing the validations in the network, he who controls the miners, controls the bitcoins.

607,4918740,1512850057,  IOTA's coin supply is just slightly higher than Bitcoin's (IOTA compared to Satoshis).  IOTA is still in its early phase so a better wallet and the removal of the coordinator are ahead of us.  IOTA also won't have all these problems with greedy miners.
608,4918744,1512850073, Why
609,4918747,1512850087,  So just read more about the tangle. Why do you think that such a lot of big corporations partner with them. Dont you think those firms check their investments?
610,4918788,1512850146,"  Like the other guy, I don't trust their technology either. I also don't see why companies would use IOTA on the tangle to settle fees between machines when the value of IOTA fluctuates wildly.

640,4919277,1512851575,"  I think bitcoin can go up for some time. But one day its exceeding power consumption will be a serious problem.  Also the transaction fees and delays make it very unconvenient as a currency. So one day the times of Bitcoin will be over (dont know if in 2 or 5 years).  But this will not be the end of cryptocurrencies. I think one day people will pay their everyday transactions in a cryptocurrency.  I just dont think it will be a blockchain based cryptocurrency.

If everyone had to confirm two external transactions to send his own the network would inevitably grind to a total halt due to lack of transactions.

652,4919654,1512852722,"HERE IS HOW TO BUY IOTA ON BINANCE:  1) Create a binance account. Use referral code 11682017 if you feel like being nice since you're using my guide - or don't, up to you.  2) Send them some crypto. I recommend using something other than Bitcoin since btc is congested right now. HERE IS A TRICK I USED: I had Bitcoin since before the forks, so I split out my BTG and sold it all. BTG (and BCH, for that matter) have much faster moving networks right now. Use Coinami to split BTG - it's the only reliable and safe way I know of. BCH can be split using Electron Cash if you don't want to use Coinami for that. If you want more details about any of this, ask me - all I ask in return is that you use 11682017 as your code when you sign up to Binance.  3) Inside Binance, turn whatever crypto you sent into btc or eth if you didn't send btc or eth directly. There are only two trading pairs with IOTA right now for Binance, and it's BTC-IOTA and ETH-IOTA.  4) Buy IOTA. Voila! You're done. Don't be worried that withdrawals of IOTA are turned off right now. If for some reason you want to liquidate your position, just trade the IOTA back to BTC or ETH and you can withdraw that (or take it one step further and turn that BTC/ETH into something that's moving faster right now, if you like). N.B. I believe ETH network is pretty slow right now due to cryptokitties but they may have gotten that under control? Not sure on this, don't currently own any ETH.  Your mileage may vary on transaction times on BTC right now - I've heard conflicting reports. Personally I'm able to get pretty decent speed confirmations lately (within an hour)."

Anyone with money to short BTC with futures is already heavily invested into bitcoin.  It makes more sense that the BIG money will bet on btc going all the way to mars...  Why? Because they already own truckloads of bitcoin and they want it to go up higher..  If they Buy buy buy buy buy soon as you retards are done selling in a panic, you will ALLL immediately jump back into btc and try ride their mars mission.  They win on futures and their current investment.  Bitcoin is going nowhere.  I'm tired of hearing normies I've spoken to about bitcoin try and explain to me that BTC is going to be worth like $3000 USD in a few weeks.

I don't care because all my investments are solid. I'm done investing.  I'm holding for 6 months plus before I will even consider swing trading yet alone selling.
778,4919258,1512851526, Well original start changed slightly as you know.  I'm currently x5 my original investment.  I feel like I am at an advantage that I am incapable of feeling emotions over things like money.

794,4920240,1512854502," It is the same thing they did with Bcash. They got half the old BTC money to dump into that stating it is the 'real' btc. Now if the old BTC holder wanted to buy back, not only have they lost 50% on bcash assuming they bought in at about $2200 but they would also have to pay 3x the amount they sold their BTC for. I wonder how many fell into that trap, I know of at least 1 person. Mcaffy is probably in on it. TPTB want a 51% stake in the BTC market. The like the number 51 even though it isn't as relevant for a market with variable circulation and so many HODLing. They will use futures and their market control to buy more btc and gain more btc market dominance and control thus enabling them ever-increasing control over the futures 'results'. If there are more people going long, they dump, more going short, they pump. It is win/win for them and unique from your average stock manipulation due to its decentralised victims. No shareholders to piss off or to get in agreement manipulating the price. BTC has become (((their))) free market to do with as they please. Bitcoin will probably go up in the long run, especially after they hit 10+million owned if that is possible. Whatever happens, they will make a killing in the process. Ironically the only hope is Bcash now, Jhin needs to take his miners off bitcoin and others like him, the ppl with money still in bitcoin needs to dump into cash and maybe they can destroy bitcoin and wallstreets entire stake along with it. Just pointing out that Bcash has pumped every 4 months, it is due one in Jan/Feb. Flippening?"

844,4920271,1512854612," Researched them all.  Coinmarketcal is easy, as is following Telegram and Twitter.  I like the 3-coin approach. BTC + 2 Solid Alts, but I feel like 2018 is the year of the alts.  2017 was the year of BTCs true beginning and the year of the ICO.  2018 should see those ICOs and previous alt coins increase in market size tremendously.  I can see BTC maybe 5x - 7x next year, but a lot of these alts will 5x - 30x as the overall market ratio of BTC dominance drops compared to the market."
845,4920428,1512855058,Fiatcoins are still fiat in value ffs. The next gen will be better and backed by energy.
846,4920749,1512856134, Explain or link?
847,4920909,1512856658, It's still in development but energy is the currency of the universe. The ultimate endgame to efficiency is understanding science. Energy coins will merge sci and biz. Of course this is my opinion. Google energy backed cryptos for more ideas. Most of these ideas are still in development. Fiatcoins are still based on electric costs anyways. At least ltc and ethereum address the engineering limitations of btc. The ethereum founder himself said that btc is not efficient in terms of engineering and will damage the environment. Those who disagree do not understand science and coding itself. Btc uses the electric consumption of Serbia.
848,4920995,1512856858,"Which is why btc can not be global as a main currency, due to the current energy infrastructure that we humans have."
849,4921076,1512857099, >salt 5%  niggah do you not see that 1 million dollar support at .016 eth? you better get more in that shit
850,4921283,1512857771," Btc doesnt have any value but what people are willing to pay  But there are new ideas for coins that are actually tied to reality in some form.  An energy coin is basically worth the value of the cost of producing it.   Which probably will be its own bubble, because energy production alone isnt a global standard."
851,4921342,1512857974," I'm talking about using energy itself as a currency through the use of many mediums, one method includes crypto. Not just electricity. And it can't be artificially inflated like btc (fiatcoin)."

869,4919497,1512852210," I can agree understanding the programming behind is useful. That being said, if you have analytical abilities and an understanding how how something would work and be implemented, then you don't really need cryptography and computational sciences.

However, it's important to weigh the short and long term effectiveness of your solutions, and the plan does not have to be the same for both (short and long term). I see no reason why BTC didn't decide to expand the blocksize until their shit was figured out, and disagree heavily with centralized offchain solutions.   However, all of that aside, after I met Rodger (figuratively, by watching his vids and such) I NOPE'd tf out of BCH.

1089,4920653,1512855776," No. It's Bitcoin without the Segwit upgrade which, as well as offering long term scaleability options, counters the use of ASICBOOST, which gives Bitmain, the mining company, an unfair advantage. And don't forget that with the ""superior"" features you mention comes a reduction in security and more centralisation of nodes, making it easier to co-opt and control, ignorant n00b."
1090,4920696,1512855941," >it wasn't for the good of bitcoin  Why would it be? BCH is a direct competitor and it's followers believe it to be superior, there is nor eason for it to be anything but hostile, economically and technologically. And please do list the lies."
1091,4920707,1512855973,"ITT; millennials pretend this isn't a dead cat bounce as everyone divests in BTC and buys LTE, link, etc."
1092,4920735,1512856056, Does segwit offer any advantages to a chain that's expanded it's block size? And how does increased blocksize reduce secuirty?
1093,4920744,1512856118," 3,1,4,2.   You can see some niptip on 3."
1094,4920753,1512856138," > as well as offering long term scaleability options  This is Core's problem though, BCH improves the network massively in terms of speed and fees, and it does so RIGHT NOW. This simple fact alone overrides everything you have said.   Also you can lie about it being less secure all you want, it doesn't make it true. And it's laughable to talk about centralization of nodes when you support LN."
1095,4920797,1512856284," This. I don't care about the plans 1-2 weeks/months/years away, there is no reason BTC shouldn't have adopted increased block size, even if it just as a very short term solution."
1096,4920812,1512856328," Yeah so much dumb money in /biz/ the last few days. Idiots going into alts and bragging about ""muh 10% moon"".   They have no idea they are about to get rekd as we hit 100k bitcoin next year. Bankers are SCARED of bitcoin. Seriously. They tried to block the futures next week. They are talking about a ""system risk"" Bitcoin poses.   Bitcoin is about to go absolutely ballistic."
1097,4920859,1512856479," >muh moon I think it's especially funny cuz most are still below previous sat value.  You arguement presents some contradicitons though, why would it go ballistic if the big money hates it, accoridng to you?"
1098,4920993,1512856855," You think they will win and manipulate the market to the point they can beat Bitcoin.   In that case the price would go down. But in this battle, they will lose (at least at first, until they officially come to accept and endorse Bitcoin and crpyto - cos it sure as fuck aint going anywhere anytime soon)."
1099,4921067,1512857080," you are a fool to underestimate the Jew bankers, not to mention every government on earth which is getting MASSIVELY shorted on taxes. you'll find out eventually. i'm not surprised its gotten this high, and i wouldn't be that amazed if it gets considerably higher (50k) but what goes up must come down son. if you think the USD is a fiat currency, lol, you will learn the hard way what the term REALLY means."
1100,4921095,1512857164," You are an idiot. I didn't state any of my beliefs, only extrapolated from your statememts. My ""beleifs"" were the logical extensions of what you just said. You are literally arguing against yourself here, and it says a lot that you didn't realize this.  Why would the endorse Bitcoin, ever? Cryptocurrency undermines the global hierarchy structure, and could quickly dissolve thier position in the world. If it's a real threat, they will do their absolute best to exterminate, and they pull the political strings as wel."
1101,4921289,1512857780," >Why would the endorse Bitcoin, ever?  Because eventually they will have no choice. They are fighting it now sure. But eventually they will have no choice but to accept it and play the crpyto game when it gets too massive to ignore.  The flipping will be when JP Morgan comes out shilling crypto. Seriously, it will happen but there will be a new CEO by then."
1102,4921325,1512857918," They'll go down fighting tooth and nail before endorising it. No banking institution will ever endorse, but individuals will.   Do you not understand that a JP Morgan CEO ""shilling"" crypto is shilling himself out of business?"
1103,4921467,1512858379," Come on man you don't get my post.   They are fighting it now and are against it but they WILL have no choice but to bow down and endorse it when they realize they are losing and missing out on money but not getting involved.  The fact Bitcoin futures are going live tomorrow is fucking massive. It's a historical event. Crypto has been legitimatized already by the bankers.   The only thing dumb misconception here is that the bankers will short it and win and crpyto and bitcoin will die and fade to obscurity and it will be ""back to normal"". It's only going to get bigger from here lads."
1104,4921519,1512858543, Pleast stop shilling this shitcoin and let it die in peace as the rotten scam it is.
1105,4921569,1512858686," >The only thing dumb misconception here is that the bankers will short it and win and crpyto and bitcoin will die and fade to obscurity and it will be ""back to normal"". It's only going to get bigger from here lads.  So you don't think (((they))) are going to manipulate the price of BTC with buys and sells of it while holding orders of magnitude more in short/long bets in cash settled derivatives to cheat money out of the derivatives market?  That's very bluepilled. Bitcoin derivatives was the worst thing that could happen to bitcoin before bitcoin became useful and in-use as a currency for everyday trade. It's 100% a speculative asset right now that isn't backed by any real use and its thus very easy to manipulate up and down.  Expect major dump and pump action before new year."

1109,4922276,1512860676," I believe it is YOU who doesn't get your own post, and reasoning, fucktard.  They will NEVER endorse it, as an instutition. As an example, why would a horse drawn chariot manufacturer endorse Henry Ford and his automobiles? He fucking wouldn't, and he'd spread mad FUD about it until he was bankrupt.   I agree that it's only getting bigger long term, but you're being a dummy, and as the other poster said, blue pilled.    I already made a killing of BCH before the fake flippening, and I watch it closely for round 2. I hope you followed what I had to say in this thread, because I'm agnostic towards both ultimately, from an investment perspective."

1396,4921911,1512859655," I'm sorry you don't understand. I'll try to make it easy. Smart contracts are the future because it's essentially a gauranteed contract. If we trade, a smart contract is a magic box that only opens when we both put what the other wants into it. Without ChainLink you don't know how to put real shit in the box, only digital who givesashits. ChainLink connects things like banks and companies to actual smart contracts(insert smart contract coin). Smart contract X coin might beat Y coin. Doesn't matter they both need ChainLink. Why? Oracles. What's that? A server. Banks and companies like security. All coins use centralizes oracles, only chainlink decentralizes. If a company doesn't use chainlink but has smart contracts if I take a literal piss on their server(oracle) I fuck their shit. Magic box don't open. If there are thousands of oracles(only available through chainlink) I don't possibly have dnough piss for them all, i.e. secure.  Summary: if smart contracts are the future(they are) chainlink is the future(it is).  Unless I r retarded brainlet, but that was my take away."
1397,4921912,1512859657,"  stop spoonfeeding this people, they haven't read the WP, they dont understand the tech, they dont even understand why use ETH instead of BTC for transferring funds, this is the people that end up selling and making the coin fall to new ATLs"

1402,4922200,1512860491, theres another player trying to do the same thing  aeternity. to say that chain link is going to take off is stupid
1403,4922213,1512860511," Aeternity a shit vaporware, they give half of one page in their whitepaper to explain their tech and its all buzz wordy slight of hand.

Some fucking kitties clogged up the eth network so badly that I had to wait 12 hours for transfer because some douche was tending to his fucking virtual pet.

1423,4921361,1512858026, Thank you for not being a faggot OP
1424,4921380,1512858093," This is much more than a coin, it's a blockchain router.  The BLOCK token monetizes the network. Service nodes connect blockchains together using the Blocknet protocol:  ETH to BTC BTC to LTC LTC to VTC etc, etc, etc  And all of this is done in a fully trustless manner - no service nodes ever handle any coins or funds. This is made possible through the atomic swap process.  The Blocknet is showcasing this technology by building a fully trustless decentralized exchange that is scheduled to launch here within the next month or 2.  The exchange will be great for traffic, but the real bang for your buck here is the interoperability and the technology of connecting blockchains together without have each blockchain adopt code and hard fork to become compatible with the interchain router. When blockchain tech matures, there will always be a need to have a way of getting from one chain to the other as it will be a means of transporting assets, information, etc.  Chain specifics: PoS chain, service nodes (masternodes), and all fees earned (100%) through the use of the decentralized exchange and blockchain router will be allocated to service node operators and stakers."

Currently staking ROI is over 20%/year and that is what you'll receive right now before the exchange launches.  Already have Bitfinex on board to extend the orderbook to and are working on adding others also. All of this equates to massive volume on the exchange."

1437,4922354,1512860939," Bittrex   The UI version of the exchange isn't live yet: will be in the next month or so. These calculations are conservative too. If the exchange sees the same volume as Binance, you can double that figure to $1.00/BLOCK owned per day"

1440,4922503,1512861284,"  so in laymens terms, this wil BTFO the exchange platforms that charges fees, no? meaning to say why use a platform with fees when you can use BLOCKNET will do it for free?"
1441,4922607,1512861552," I think it will because like you said, people are tired of waiting to be credited with bitcoin forks because they don't own their private keys, they're tired of getting hacked or set with withdrawal limits, they're tired of giving them all their personal information just to get verified, etc.   Yes, staking your Block or running a service node = passive income at ~20%/year now. When the exchange goes live this will be unbelievably higher because you will start collecting exchange fees   There are many competitive advantages here. For one, yes, the DX will still charge fees, but they will be 1/2 the price of regular exchanges because you wont have to switch to BTC just to get from one alt to the next. On the Blocknet DX you can trade directly from LTC to DGB or VTC to DOGE and any other trading pairs supported on the DX."

1454,4920508,1512855292,So what is the rate of mining in terms of BWK tokens? Is it realistic for me to get in and try to mine this? (No coding experience and only a gaming PC)
1455,4920513,1512855305, Fug do you set up a node through the wallet? I?m just mining off a pool atm
1456,4920533,1512855345,"  Masternodes validate transactions and get part of the block rewards. Once you get enough of a coin you basically lock it as collateral in a cold wallet and host a node via a VPS (the VPS node doesn't hold the coins, just checks the cold wallet to make sure they're locked).  BWK requires 5000 coins to host a node though there are some community / grouped nodes operating where people have a share of the node. I'm 90 days masternodes will get 50% of block rewards to split between themselves. Currently it's at 20% to incentivize miners.  My favorite part of this coin is that there are no shitskins on the team"
1457,4920570,1512855470," Lol, I definitely find myself have more positive outlooks when the team is comprised of white guys out of more developed countries.  I need to do more reading into mining possible specifically about mining BWK. Seems really promising but I am new to crypto and so far all I am experienced with is pushing money around on exchanges."

I cashed out and did very well, so if it continues to moon I won't be too bothered.  I overheard a few of my brother's friends (great dude, but really stupid) talking about it, and at that point I knew it was time to get out. The average normie investor is in this because they want the price to rise. They don't care about the tech, the products, the altcoins, they just think it's a money tree. At some point that will end, and there will be a herd of normies cashing out all at once.  The final red flag to me is the entire drama with Bitfinex & Tether. I won't go into too many details (you can find a lot of info on Google) but basically I think there is a large aspect of the market propped up by fake money and wash trading.

1699,4922069,1512860149, The coin itself has no use at all. It's simply been created as a money grab.
1700,4920872,1512856521,"I need help. A couple of days ago I purchased my first amount of bitcoin from Coinbase and sent it to a windows wallet Electrum that many blogs were recommending for storing your coins safely. Following the advice of /r/bitcoin I held onto my coins in the hope that the value would increase soon and I'd double my money. Of course, as you all know, Bitcoin took a nosedive in value yesterday and now I've lost some of my investment. For some reason I can't sell on Coinbase though as they've blocked me from doing so. Their phone lines are busy and my emails still go unanswered.  Here's the real problem though: I decided to try and sell my bitcoins on craigslist instead so I can just bypass any id verification bullshit and get usd before bitcoin falls hard. I found a buyer and he asked for payment of bitcoins upfront before he sends a wire transfer because he's been scammed too many times. Initially I was hesitant, but he assured me that I can initiate a chargeback with Electrum if he doesn't send the transfer. I finally agreed and sent him my $2,000 in btc and was happy to see the money land in my bank account just 2 hours later.   Just now though I got a call from my bank that the money he wired in is now chargebacked and I'm in the red. WTF? There is no option for chargebacks in Electrum either. Am I missing something? Please give me some advice"

1717,4921542,1512858622," Sorry nigga, no chargebacks for BTC.   You got scammed."
1718,4921704,1512859070,"Here's how you can get the same amount of BTC back.  Suppose Bitcoin goes up 100% in two months from now.  2 months = 8 weeks = 320 work hours  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you make $10.00/hr.  That means in 8 weeks, you'll have $3,200 from working your job. Two months of rent, food, gas, taxes on that wage, and the drugs that you evidently use daily, will probably bring you down to, say, $1,000.   Okay, cool. So now, in order to buy the same amount of Bitcoin, you'll need $4,000.   You wire transfer that $1,000 over to Coinbase, and it takes about a week. Now Bitcoin is up 20% from when you initiated the transfer. Now you need $4800 to buy back what you lost.   Oh wait. Nvm. You can only get a little more than 1/5 of what you previously had. Scratch that. You're fucked.  How about this. Find a time machine that would allow you to travel back to AT LEAST the moment right before you sent the BTC through Electronum. Cool. Now, before you post that ad on Craigslist, go on Google. Spend 1-5 minutes researching Electronum. Realize that there is no such thing as a charge back. Bam. Your BTC is saved. Now wait a month. Bam, 100% profit. Wait another 11 months, and bam. 500% profit. So now you went from $2,000 to $4,000, then to $20,000. Now you wait until 2020. Bam, you gain a total of 1,200% from the $20,000 mark, bringing you to a total of $240,000.  Congratulations on being an absolute retard you normie. Remember for the rest of your life to think before you act. At least a little bit... Maybe spend 2, no not even, at least ONE minute Googling, and you might just change the course of your life. Take this experience as a lesson learned and confirmation that you are a dumbass. You know what? Just stick to trying to get that assistant manager promotion at Burger King. It's sounds much more fitting for your kind of mind."
1719,4921887,1512859570,"So I guess there is no fucking chargeback in Electrum and I was stupid. Now I'm out $2,000 and I owe my bank much more than I even have. I'm at a fucking loss on this shit. I finally got through Coinbase phone support in the last few minutes though and was speaking with someone who called themselves 'mel' but had a thick accent. He apologized for the troubles and said he needed me to download an assist tool so he can help me. So I did and my screen went black and saw my mouse cursor moving on its own. I turned that shit off and am now scared to even turn my fucking PC on. ffs  I just fail"

2085,4922483,1512861255,"    people don't mean 'intrinsic' as in the adjective. 'intrinsic value' has it's own meaning when used in the context of investing.  the concept supposed to help determine if a security has become too expensive as an investment. but clearly nobody here cares about the price and just assumes bitcoin is going to moon forever, and if it crashes it's not going below where they bought it, for no reason they can articulate."
2086,4922495,1512861268," Nobody hoards dollars, m8 Kys"
2087,4922712,1512861858," >value is a psychological phenomenon A lot of people think that an item is worth something just because they put money into it. In the context of Bitcoin this is different than simply under or over valuing it. This unprecedented asset class, as another anon called it, is a psychological dominion more prone to lunacy than sense. It's borderline metaphysical. So I think Bitcoin is very subjective.  My interpretation of Bitcoin is that it's basically just gambling at a dusty old slot machine that pays out more than it should because it's broken. One day the manager is going to come and take it away along with whatever money you had left in it. I don't really consider that an investment or even speculation."
2088,4921500,1512858490,"Lets propose two options.  Option 1: You buy a 60 year old 1,200sq/ft traditional house, lets say it is $150,000 in some suburb and has a shitty single vehicle garage. Your property taxes are about $1,500 each year, along with the average utilities cost of $3,600 per year. After say 50 years of living in this home, you have paid the $150,000 + (50 x $5,100) = $405,000 to own this property for 50 years, about 1/3rd possibly in equity.  Option 2: You buy a brand new 300sq/ft tiny house, the nicest options are $80,000 after everything, and you buy 1 acre of land for $20,000 with the hookups for your appliances etc. Your property taxes would be about $1,200 per year, along with the average utilities cost of $1,200 each year. After say 50 years of living in this home, you have paid the $100,000 + (50 x $2,400) = $220,000 to own this property for 50 years, almost half possibly in equity.  These are real numbers that I have done some research compiling. Assuming your homes become worthless immediately/you don't ever plan on selling it, you are spending ~double to buy and live in a traditional house. Having the real house would be nice, and it is possible that your tiny house would depreciate like a traditional trailer home would. A tiny house is literally a house that is small enough to put onto a trailer and tow, so they aren't built like trailers but true houses, so that may be incorrect.  What are your thoughts on this shit? Think about getting out of the rat race in your early 20s with less than $200,000 and it's not even some hippy dippy living in a tent out in the woods bullshit. It's a very small house, put up a car port with some gravel for a driveway, have a garden or whatever - what is the difference between this and a larger house? Houses less than ~$150,000 are typically are in a shitty area or have problems and you wouldn't want to live there for a long time anyway."
2089,4921504,1512858498,"The other obvious option is to not give a shit and rent an apartment/shitty house and pay ~$14,400 each year. After 50 year, we have $720,000, and this would get you a 150-500sq/ft studio/1br in a nice area or something larger in a shittier area. That's clearly not worth it. Even with a very inexpensive apartment, you are paying $360,000 after 50 years and you have no equity there."

This is probably he main catch.  Otherwise, sounds like a plan.

2112,4922582,1512861483," Installing a toilet is a pain in the ass, literally. You'll also want to start a family one day, so you'll end up building extensions or a second tiny house one day anyways.   Nothing wrong with property tax in itself, since it prevents richfags from just buying all the land and monopolizing it, or at least makes it very costly to do so. However, property tax should be much lower or non-existent for small single plots indeed."

Yet every normie and weak hand autist would self-immolate and threw themselves off buildings crying about their catastrophic losses. This market is so psychotic, literally if you make even 10% a year on crypto you are doing better than any other asset class out there.

2267,4922376,1512860973," Bitfinex exits or gets shut down by authorities. Bitconnect exit scams (only if media fear mongers over it) Wallstreet faggots who bought bitcoin short the fuck out of it on derivatives exchanges and then dump the shit out of their bitcoin to flashcrash the price. BCH supporting miners stop mining bitcoin (easy chain death) Ethereum mooning and becoming the new fomo of the coins that are on normie exchanges while being heavily shilled in MSM. BCH gaining widespread merchant adoption. Bulgaria selling their 213,519 bitcoins in a dumb way.  Take your pick. Bitfinex/tether being shut down or exiting and ethereum becoming the new fomo and heavily shilled are guaranteed to happen. Bitconnect collapse too, but that's not necessarily as important.  Some crypto will get merchant adoption, especially in japan. If it's not BCH it will be something else. It for sure won't be BTC any time soon, whatever shills try to tell you about LN being useful right now or imminently.  Something will trigger a bubble pop. The only question is when. Since BTC doesn't have any real price floor because it doesn't have any usage in the near future except ""storing value"" (hoping buyers in the future will assign it value and buy it for high value, that is greater fool theory)."
2268,4922408,1512861068,"Oh, also a massive BTC selloffs by whales wanting to earn money in a flippening could trigger it.  MSM has already primed the public to see BTC decline as a bubble pop. The psychological groundwork for a flash crash has been laid."
2269,4922416,1512861078,"What could cause a crash is if the money wallstreet invested six months ago were to magically all get pulled out at once. Normies would REEEEE for regulation, which would benefit wallstreet in the long run."

2272,4922498,1512861275,"    It's unrealistic to say that any heavy holder would suddenly choose to crash the price simply because they can. It's much more profitable to hold the price steady and liquidate over many months. Governments and the rich especially have the privilege of taking their time to cash out at maximum profitability.  OTOH it's the poor who have the highest chance of causing a crash: If there is a sudden economic downturn, poors desperate for fiat will withdraw from the market at once. Their individual volumes aren't enough to sway the entire market, so they won't see it as a loss. Plus they're desperate so they'll withdraw even at a loss."

Think of how many people gamble, how many do that online, how many people that gamble online know about crypto, how many people that gamble online and use crypto and use crypto to gamble. Crypto trading is already essentially gambling too which makes the idea even more retarded  This is such a super niche market it would take 10 years"
2311,4921960,1512859815, I get the sense that the devs would have more of an interest in keeping the coin stable but with a low price to encourage normies to gamble in it

2320,4922133,1512860329,  What would they actually help doing? Not that well read when it comes to state channels.
2321,4922197,1512860488,  Why would they care if you can start a FunFair casino for FREE the first two years?  And afterwards why care spending R&D when you can start earning money instantly and pay a tiny percentage on licensing?

2324,4922329,1512860851,"  Great article, didn't know about it yet.  It doesn't explain however the Turing Complete thing they have been hinting at recently. This blog only explains gambling it seems, not the other use cases."
2325,4922407,1512861064, Essentially you could run entire smart contracts outside of the standard chain resulting in lower costs and faster transactions
2326,4922458,1512861183,  I also cannot imagine losing money on this.  If they release their current beta and get a shady license they are already miles ahead of any other crypto casino. And their plans are way bigger than doing that.  Pretty comfy with my coins. Got a shitload of them.
2327,4922504,1512861286,"  Man that would be huge.  Imagine the announcement: ""Hey while we were working on our casino state channel we realized we can do much more than that so we are releasing these revolutionary channels now.  Very curious to see what we get the 20th."

I have a weird decent gut feeling about the coin."

2432,4922155,1512860393,"You missed the fact that most people who want to take loans there already hoarded massive bags at 3USD and below so there will be little to no demand increase due to launch. The supply is also massive and diversified among many holders who hold it only as a speculative investment expecting short term massive gains.  There's also the fact that BTC is volatile as fuck and is the only collateral at launch and min margin is a mere 25%. Expect liquidations and pink wojaks.  Wait until bitfinex exits or gets shut down by authorities, or bitconnect exit scams, or wallstreet faggots who bought bitcoin short the fuck out of it on derivatives exchanges and then dump the shit out of their bitcoin to flashcrash the price.  So yeah, even if BTC wasn't going to fail, expect this to dump hard at launch when all the speculative investors in salt realize the price isn't moving upwards. Will probably bleed out for weeks until it stabilizes below 50% of current price and then slowly increases from that point onwards as the platform is used by more and more crypto newfags who didn't have the chance to hoard salt and more collateral options are added."

Also, if you already gained previlege, don't re-roll until the pot is > 0.025 ETH.  8- Someone might try to copy our system and misuse it as a scam. So we suggest two checks with which you can confirm that its us: i) Check the tripcode. All posts by us will have the same tripcode ( !!HGNMqodhKGI ) ii) We have only ONE pot address. If we ever need to change it, we will post the new address and private key of the old one.  7- All prizes will be distributed, so please be patient. 8- If a thread reaches its limit, we'll post a follow up thread with the TxHash of the winners which did not get a respond in the previous thread (its not a rolling thread). A new rolling thread will always include our Pot address. 9- Do not send more than the required entry fee in each roll.  10- We will show you that we are trustworthy once people start winning (by posting txhashes of all rewards which you can confirm on the blockchain). If we have missed any prize/rule, please inform us. 11- We (Bizzroll team) won't roll in the game."

I feel like in the past this would have been significant to me but now I don't feel anything. For some reason I don't think it's supposed to feel like this.

2768,4923569,1512864248,  Most of it's from living with my parents for two years saving 95% so the tax is paid on that and its comfortably invested traditionally. I had a half a bitcoin from the last big run up in 2013 I never got rid of that paid for my crypto adventures this year that's more recently been turned into a lot of shitcoins. Depending on how it goes I'll probably try to ride out the year to go for the long-term rate and even if not since I earn so little most of the gains will be taxed at a lower rate.

2976,4923770,1512864111, True not everything that goes up is a bubble.  If Apple went up 1700% in a year people would say it is a bubble and will crash.  If gold went up 1700% in a year people would say it is a bubble and will crash.  If Exxon-Mobil went up 1700% in a year people would say it is a bubble and will crash.

It is just too slow to adapt to new technology, and I think the friction will grow even stronger as entrenched interests begin to solidify.   So which coin do you think has the greatest potential to be the king by 2025? Personally I think it'll be Tezos since its self-amending property allow it to adapt the fastest to new competitors. Any new valuable tech can be swallowed by Tezos without a hardfork, simultaneously blocking up-and-coming cryptos from gaining traction and becoming more competitive against the big ones."

3026,4924224,1512865761,"Just a thought.  But wouldn't it make sense that whoever wants to make big bucks would intentionally inflate the shit out of bitcoin right until they could properly short it with the use of financial derivatives like futures? (Gommin in this Sunday to an exchange near u :DDDDD).  It's actually fukin funny. People had such a hard up (ideologically speaking) because Bitcoin was supposed to be a decentralized currency that was ""free"" and couldn't be manipulated by a central bank. Now it's behaving nothing like a currency and much more like a speculative asset as the media is spinning it as acceptable now with the government regulation and derivatives setup. Leading it to become exactly the opposite of what everyone initially loved about Bitcoin!  So now I ask you, coincuck. What's exactly keeping the value of Bitcoin up? Block chain? The same thing behind thousands of other meme coins? Decentralized digital currency? That no retailer in their right mind would trade in (Bitpay converts into local currency for the idiots who don't understand it)? or no employer in their right mind would accept or pay employees with (due to going into bear market in a span of 24 hours)? An asset that backs it? Good joke.  NIGGER, WHAT IS HOLDING THE VALUE OF BITCOIN UP!?!?!?!?!?  I'll tell you.   The only thing holding up Bitcoin, is the amount of bandwagoners who are buying it to get rich.  There is no ideology anymore, there is no tech any more, there is no tangible asset, there is no secrecy anymore.  The only thing holding Bitcoin up is basically a ponzi scheme. Where it will only continue to make money if it sucks more people in, and will lead to a stand-still if it doesn't.  Once it starts a serious fall (none of this 24 hour bear market shit) the vast majority of investors will leave the same way they came in. Based on emotion. And all of you fuckers will go begging and whoring on the street like a pack of hobos for a piece of bread."
