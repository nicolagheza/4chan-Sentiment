1,4913017,1512834468,DragonChain holders are you all feeling comfy?   The team is doing good things and will probably overtake Stratis. No problem issuing to US citizens during ICO and Bittrex is just down the block from their office.  This coin ticks all the right boxes.,
2,4913040,1512834537,Just HODL.,

10,4913317,1512835366,  lol just noticed it but they must've had some Disney artist help them out with that.,
11,4913369,1512835518,waiting for it to appear on binance... or should I just get on ether delta or bittrex?,
12,4913435,1512835674,  Tough one. You might be able to catch a Binance dip or get in early now on Ether Delta whilst it is flying under the radar.,
13,4913674,1512836349,Why does this have such a high market cap already,
14,4913767,1512836621,  Because it is a blockchain coin and it is targeting businesses that are using blockchain technology. Their platform is to make it easy for normie developers to implement blockchains without intermediate blockchain knowledge. It's the reason Stratis once hit 1 billion market cap and is now on 800 mill because it is .NET based for .NET developers.,
15,4913866,1512836850," But won't stratis, etc. have a huge head start",
16,4913871,1512836863,"Anyone here in the Stratis ICO? I put $3000 into Stratis ICO, my port is worth $900K as of this month. I am getting the same vibes from Dragon. The way it supports multiple programming languages with incubators. The difference I see in this coin is its US based giving them a huge edge. Also the branding power will help with adoption. With Disney ""sorta"" allowing them to use their branding. If it gets big enough, Disney will pounce and start adopting their blockchain.",
17,4913879,1512836871, >man this looks like the dumbest shit >*checks marketcap* dude what the fuck 100mil marketcap circulating supply 200mil marketcap on total supply  what the fuck is this shit? i quickly speed read that picture and it makes it sound like a ponzi scheme someone quickrundown what this is exactly please?,
18,4913912,1512836965, just buy,
19,4913929,1512837032,  Of course Stratis has been doing their thing for awhile. Dragonchain already had 2 years of development under Disney. Now they just gotta polish it off and start implementing solutions with it. So if you take it like for like I am expecting it will get up to the $1 billion market cap. And it is based in Seattle where a lot of big tech companies are too so they will be interested in checking out Dragonchain's blockchain platform.,
20,4913978,1512837176, Nothing wrong with some incentive to HOLD the token. They discovered that Bitconnect works fuckin amazingly well and just applying a legit version to their tokens.,
21,4913987,1512837212,  Here is how you can use the Dragonchain platform: https://dragonchain.github.io/blockchain-use-cases,
22,4914052,1512837380,  Totally agree. Impressive you managed to hold your Stratis from ICO up until now.  I think Disney will come back to Dragonchain as well when they are fully operational.,
23,4914273,1512838072, I only invest in long term projects and don't flip.,

922,4919787,1512853136," As long as this is on a different computer it won't fuck everything up - you can always delete the install and start again. I'm assuming that it thinks that it's a BIP39 seed if it's not showing you the next button.

924,4920068,1512854049," Yes. If it's using BIP39 then the only way possible to recover the wallet is to enter the same password that it was setup with. I would try it and see what happens. If it doesn't work delete the wallet and try again with a different password. You can keep trying as many times as you want. Just to reiterate - this is on a fresh computer? If so, you can experiment as much as you like and keep retrying.",

He sent me 15 characters from his encryption password, not sure what I could do now. The 15 characters he sent me are a mix of capital letters, lowercase letters, and just general ascii symbols. I'm gonna try to make a new wallet (empty), encrypt it, and see how long the password it gives me is. Hopefully it's the same number of characters for any kind of wallet.",

There’s also Sergie’s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from satoshi nakamoto's literature, for instance. The investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise it’s not just brilliant- it can change people's LIVES. As a consequence, people who dislike Chainlink truly ARE idiots. Of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergie’s existential catchphrase, “Oracles R Us,” which in and of itself is a cryptic reference. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Chainlink development team's genius wit unfolds itself on their Binance trading screens.

The hints are extrenely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the banking system most of the hints will go over a typical newfag’s head. There’s also Sergie’s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from satoshi nakamoto's literature, for instance. The investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise it’s not just brilliant- it can change people's LIVES. As a consequence, people who dislike Chainlink truly ARE idiots. Of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergie’s existential catchphrase, “Oracles R Us,” which in and of itself is a cryptic reference. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Chainlink development team's genius wit unfolds itself on their Binance trading screens.

His weight gain coincides with the progression of his illness. As his illness progresses and his body deteriorates, he has to take more and more time off. He and Steve are trying to get the oracle network up and running before Sergey passes. After Sergey dies, his 300,000,000 LINKs will be locked away forever. If Sergey and Steve succeed- that 300,000,000 LINK will be the greatest untouchable wealth the world has ever seen.  Right now Sergey is in Sri Lanka because he is a virgin and he wants to get laid before he dies. He confided this to me right before SIBOS began. He's on one final vacation, where he plans to lose his virginity and then come back and complete the Chainlink network full steam ahead and a new man.  Sergey knows he'll never live to see Chainlink at it's fullest, but he wants to be remembered. That's why the 300,000,000 will be locked away. He will be the richest man who never lived, and all of humanity will know.   And to answer your question, this won't move for another year might as well sell now.",

Thanks for the reassurance.   Why do you think they're going to raise the platform price? I think I have an idea but I'd like to your take as well as whoever else wants to give an input.    Why do you think SALT will go so low? Wouldn't it be in the interest of people that own lots of SALT to push the price up so less people can use it to reduce interest rates?,

No. If you actually read the post you would understand why.   >Why do you think SALT will go so low? Wouldn't it be in the interest of people that own lots of SALT to push the price up so less people can use it to reduce interest rates? If whalesgroups with 100m USD+ that isn't already in salt manipulate the price like that, yeah.  Betting on whales manipulating your own coin in a certain way is pretty spooky though. If anything, if they have lots of salt, they will first dump it hard, then mass buy at a lower price, then keep pumping it, then maybe dump and pump it again until they called it a day and pump it to rest in the 20-24USD range until Salt Lending raises the salt price.",

1857,4919654,1512852722,"HERE IS HOW TO BUY IOTA ON BINANCE:  1) Create a binance account. Use referral code 11682017 if you feel like being nice since you're using my guide - or don't, up to you.  2) Send them some crypto. I recommend using something other than Bitcoin since btc is congested right now. HERE IS A TRICK I USED: I had Bitcoin since before the forks, so I split out my BTG and sold it all. BTG (and BCH, for that matter) have much faster moving networks right now. Use Coinami to split BTG - it's the only reliable and safe way I know of. BCH can be split using Electron Cash if you don't want to use Coinami for that. If you want more details about any of this, ask me - all I ask in return is that you use 11682017 as your code when you sign up to Binance.  3) Inside Binance, turn whatever crypto you sent into btc or eth if you didn't send btc or eth directly. There are only two trading pairs with IOTA right now for Binance, and it's BTC-IOTA and ETH-IOTA.  4) Buy IOTA. Voila! You're done. Don't be worried that withdrawals of IOTA are turned off right now. If for some reason you want to liquidate your position, just trade the IOTA back to BTC or ETH and you can withdraw that (or take it one step further and turn that BTC/ETH into something that's moving faster right now, if you like). N.B. I believe ETH network is pretty slow right now due to cryptokitties but they may have gotten that under control? Not sure on this, don't currently own any ETH.  Your mileage may vary on transaction times on BTC right now - I've heard conflicting reports. Personally I'm able to get pretty decent speed confirmations lately (within an hour).",

Because they already own truckloads of bitcoin and they want it to go up higher..

2038,4920240,1512854502," It is the same thing they did with Bcash. They got half the old BTC money to dump into that stating it is the 'real' btc. Now if the old BTC holder wanted to buy back, not only have they lost 50% on bcash assuming they bought in at about $2200 but they would also have to pay 3x the amount they sold their BTC for. I wonder how many fell into that trap, I know of at least 1 person. Mcaffy is probably in on it. TPTB want a 51% stake in the BTC market. The like the number 51 even though it isn't as relevant for a market with variable circulation and so many HODLing. They will use futures and their market control to buy more btc and gain more btc market dominance and control thus enabling them ever-increasing control over the futures 'results'. If there are more people going long, they dump, more going short, they pump. It is win/win for them and unique from your average stock manipulation due to its decentralised victims. No shareholders to piss off or to get in agreement manipulating the price. BTC has become (((their))) free market to do with as they please. Bitcoin will probably go up in the long run, especially after they hit 10+million owned if that is possible. Whatever happens, they will make a killing in the process. Ironically the only hope is Bcash now, Jhin needs to take his miners off bitcoin and others like him, the ppl with money still in bitcoin needs to dump into cash and maybe they can destroy bitcoin and wallstreets entire stake along with it. Just pointing out that Bcash has pumped every 4 months, it is due one in Jan/Feb. Flippening?",

Long term, I see the issue with consistantly increasing block size, and how this could hypothetically lead to increased centralization, while smaller blocks may lead the other way, as more hardware is able to effectively participate.  However, it's important to weigh the short and long term effectiveness of your solutions, and the plan does not have to be the same for both (short and long term). I see no reason why BTC didn't decide to expand the blocksize until their shit was figured out, and disagree heavily with centralized offchain solutions.   However, all of that aside, after I met Rodger (figuratively, by watching his vids and such) I NOPE'd tf out of BCH.
